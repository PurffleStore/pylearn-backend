Behind the glass, the baker Lars is kneading soft dough, and the flour is floating like tiny snow in the air. The oven is warm, and fresh bread is coming out, so the whole place smells sweet. A little cat named Nina is sitting on a chair and watching the buns quietly. One bun slips a little, and Lars catches it quickly with a smile. The children are looking and pointing because everything is happening right in front of them. Every morning, Lars opens the bakery early, bakes bread, and puts it on the shelf in neat rows. Nina also comes every day and sits in the same chair as if it is her seat. The children understand the story because they can see what is happening now, and they can also feel what happens as a daily routine. When we talk about what is happening now, or what happens regularly, we are using the present tense.",
